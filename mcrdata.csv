The new organisation brought together a group of nine hospitals plus community services, providing a once in a lifetime opportunity to deliver even better services for the people of Manchester, Trafford and beyond. Key Figures: The Trust employs over 20000 Staff, has 2500 beds and an annual turnover of almost £1.6 billion. Our staff attend more than 1,725000 outpatients per year, deliver over 13000 babies and carry out in excess of 189000 operations per year and see in excess of 405000 patients in our A&E departments. The Trust is the largest provider for undergraduate training and the R&D department is the largest in the North West. The Alliance-MFT cross-sectional cardiac Imaging unit was established in 2008 and is housed in a purpose built 2 storey unit within the North West Heart Centre on Wythenshawe Campus (previously University Hospital of South Manchester). The unit is one of very few dedicated cross-sectional cardiac Imaging units in the country and houses 2 CMR scanners (1.5T and 3T) and 1 cardiac CT scanner. Additionally, the unit is equipped with a modern RIS/PACS system and reporting facilities including multi-modality post processing and research software packages (7 CVI 42, 3 VES and Q-Mass licences).

Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT) was formed on the 1st October 2017 as an NHS Group of Acute and Specialist Hospitals and is on an exciting mission to provide world-class healthcare to the people of Manchester, Trafford, and the surrounding areas, and for some of our services, nationally. Benefitting from the support of a progressive academic science centre which is leading health innovation within the UK, our teams are dedicated to working collectively to provide a seamless Single Hospital Service, ultimately improving health outcomes for our local communities. The resulting environment is one of optimistic expectation and it is this varied and dynamic challenge that you will be nurturing as Director of HR&OD in our largest hospital. As a newly formed Group, we are seeking a talented senior HR/OD professional to join the Hospital Leadership Team and to be part of a network of Hospital based Directors working across the Groups’ six hospitals. Our current search for talent is focussed at one of our six sites, Wythenshawe, the largest of our hospitals with a turnover of circa £470m and 5449 staff. With these kind of numbers, we are inevitably keen to attract an inspirational Human Resources Director with previous experience as a Director in either a smaller Hospital or a non-healthcare organisation employing a large number of professionals or significant experience as a Deputy in a large Acute hospital within a similarly complex environment. Reporting to the Chief Executive, the Hospital Director of HR and OD will work as an integral member of the Hospital Leadership supporting the Hospital Chief Executive in developing a compelling vision and narrative. You’ll develop a vibrant staff engagement strategy to ensure our people understand the hospital’s vision and have the ambition to personally contribute to ensuring the hospital consistently delivers its strategic goal of delivering consistently high-quality, safe patient care. Implementing a forward-thinking workforce strategy and supporting organisational development (OD), you will work to guide all HR matters that impact on hospital delivery and performance, ensuring our staff has the necessary skills, knowledge and support to deliver their best performance. Extending from talent development to performance management, your expertise will impact on everything from succession planning to recruitment and retention, building workforce capacity and nurturing talent you will be able to smooth out any issues that might otherwise detract from the exceptional capabilities of these highly skilled professionals. Enjoying the supportive network that has come with our merger, you will have the backing of the other HRDs in the Group. Also benefiting from Group structure, you’ll have more time to do the job you love, without being distracted by the necessary governance commitments which will be undertaken at a board level. This highly desirable role is perfectly suited to a dynamic self-starter with a wealth of OD and HR expertise gained in a senior role within a complex organisation. Membership of the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development is desirable but not essential, but the ability to quickly build relationships with a whole range of stakeholders at all levels is key and having the drive to influence outcomes is critical coupled with your exceptional leadership skills. We believe in providing a vibrant and engaging working atmosphere for our staff, with good career progression and the scope to make the most of their skills. If you would enjoy ensuring these two elements are combined for optimum results, then we would be delighted to work together. MFT is committed to promoting equality of opportunity, celebrating and valuing diversity and eliminating any form of unlawful discrimination across our workforce, ensuring our people are truly representative of the communities we serve. For an informal and confidential discussion, please speak with our advisor at Odgers Berndtson; Helen Childs 0207 529 1093. Closing Date: 6th March 2019  Interview Date: 22nd March 2019   For further details / informal visits contact:Helen Childs Consultant – Healthcare Practice ODGERS BERNDTSON 20 Cannon Street London EC4M 6XD Direct: +44 (0)207 529 1093 | Mobile: +44 (0)77363 78474 PA: Kelly Stokes +44 207 529 3094We may decide to close this vacancy earlier than the published closing date if sufficient applications are received.Trust policy requires that the cost of submitting & processing the successful applicant/s DBS application be recovered via salary deduction in the first 3 months following start in post.
